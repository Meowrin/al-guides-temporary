# Beginner 101

So you just downloaded this waifu collector gacha game called Azur Lane, you went through the starting tutorial and now met with a UI that makes no sense and guides that uses shorthand that makes no sense. Well let me explain the UI in a straight forward manner but before we begin here's a guide to [**BIND YOUR FOOKING ACCOUNT**](https://i.imgur.com/roy6tih.jpg), because you do not need to reroll in Azur Lane like most other gacha games, here's a short list of reasons why:

- Cubes and Gold are given in abundance when you are starting out. You'll get the ships you want eventually.
- A large majority of high value ships are not SSR rarity.
- Several of the most cost-effective, progression-friendly ships are drops, not builds.
- The tutorial can take 15 minutes or longer.
- SSR rates are 7% anyway.

## Useful Shorthands
<details>
  <summary> Rarity </summary>
  
  * Common: N (Grey/White)
  * Rare: R (Blue)
  * Elite: SR (Purple)
  * Super Rare: SSR (Yellow)
  * Ultra Rare: UR (Rainbow)
  * Prototype Rare: PR (Yellow)
  * Decisive Rare: DR (Rainbow)
  * Why is this like this? Don't ask me, idk, JP/FGO stuffs. It makes more sense to say it like that, EN do have a tendency to call Super Rare as SR but then get stumped on what to call purple cause Elite just sounds strange, what kind of rarity is Elite? Can someone please enlighten me on this?

  <summary> Factions </summary>
  
  * Sakura Empire: IJN
  * Eagle Union: USS
  * Royal Navy: HMS
  * Ironblood: KMS
  * Eastern Radiance: ROC/PRAN
  * North Union: SN
  * Iris Libre: FFNF
  * Vichya Dominion: MNF
  * Sardegna Empire: RN
  * There's also 2 common names for gears: SKC for German equipment and MLE for France equipment. Because these are present in the name so it's a bit more intuitive like that.

  <summary> Hull Class </summary>

- Vanguard Ships
  * Destroyer: DD ![DD](/resources/45px-DD_img40.png)
  * Light Cruiser: CL ![CL](/resources/45px-CL_img40.png)
  * Heavy Cruiser: CA ![CA](/resources/45px-CA_img40.png)
  * Large Cruiser: CB ![CB](/resources/45px-CB_img40.png)
- Main Fleet Ships  
  * Battleship: BB ![BB](/resources/45px-BC_img40.png)
  * Battlecruisers: BC ![BC](/resources/45px-BC_img40.png)
  * Aviation Battleships: BBV ![BBV](/resources/45px-BBV_img40.png)
  * Monitors: BM ![BM](/resources/45px-BM_img40.png)
  * Aircraft Carriers: CV ![CV](/resources/45px-CVL_img40.png)
  * Light Aircraft Carriers: CVL ![CVL](/resources/45px-CVL_img40.png)
  * Repair Ships: AR ![AR](/resources/45px-AR_img40.png)
- Submarines
  * Submarines: SS ![SS](/resources/45px-SS_img40.png)
  * Submarine Carriers: SSV ![SSV](/resources/45px-SSV_img40.png)
- The ship hull class can be intuited through their icons but some just have downright the same icon therefore the only way to know what ship is in what hull class is in their ship profile in the dock. Explained later in the Dock section.
- What does all this even mean? 
     1. Vanguard ships including: DD, CL, CA and CB are your "frontline" ships, the ones that you actually control with your joystick. 
     2. Main fleet ships including: BB, BC, BBV, BM, CV, CVL and AR are your "backline" ships, who provide Artillery support fire and/or Airstrikes (BBVs provide both). 
     3. Submarine fleet including SS and SSV is another can of worm, unlocked after you clear chapter 3 map 4. A detailed guide about Submarines, Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW) and Rescue Missions can be found [here made by pootatoast](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/User:Itsfyh/Submarines) (also in the helpful resources section of the readme)

<details>
  <summary> Miscellaneous acronyms </summary>
  
  * Equipment:
    - Class guns such as DD, CL, CA, BB are named accordingly: DD gun, CL gun, CA gun, BB gun
    - Dive Bombers: DB
    - Torpedo Bombers: TB
    - Anti-air Gun: AA
  * Limit Break: LB (all ships have 3 LB level: LB1, LB2 and LB3 or Max LB = MLB)
  * Blueprints: as there are many type of blueprints in the game, from PR ship blueprints to equipment blueprints, they are all collectively called BPs
  * Research ships and blueprints are collectively called PR (prototype) so PR BPs generally refers to PR ship BP (the currency to enhance PR ships)
  * Cognitive Chips (Mental Units): are often shorthanded to Chips or Cog Chips. ~~what I'd like to call Mindbreaker Juice~~ 
  * Upgrade Parts are generally called Plates instead, e.g Torp Plates instead of Torpedo Parts, AA Plates instead of Anti-Air Gun Part,  Aux Plates instead of General Parts. Why is General Parts called Aux Plates? Because Auxiliary Equipment, the 2 slots that all ships have (3 for ARs), are upgraded with General Parts so it becomes Aux Plates.

<sup> I, Bucky </sup>

### Top bar (element 1-6)
- **Element 1:** **the LV. is your HQ or Commander level**, leveling up while grants little to no immediate benefits but is quintessential to your progression ([details here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Experience#Commander_XP)). Clicking on your secretary portrait takes you to your profile page. The profile page show you some basic data with some customization options. 
  * Top right "Style" is where you can customize your profile and chat border as well as medallion showcase. 
  * Bottom left is where you can change your greetings. 
  * Bottom right is where you can change your secretary as well as set your main secretary (who gains 1 affection every 300-320 mins). You unlock more secretary slots for cosmetics after clearing the specified story maps.
- **Element 2:** is your quick access side bar. You can collect Canteen Oil and Merchant Coins passive generation here without going to the Academy page, check on Commission teams, Tactical Classroom (NOT the Lecture Hall) and your Research Academy. One of the places you will check the most in the game.
- **Element 3:** Your "Beginner Missions" that gives a lot of resources and an SSR ship at the end (all 4 ship is also permanent available, recommendation for the ship is Hood if you don't have a BB/BC or Enterprise if you need a CV, Sandy is nice with retro but not that needed)
- **Element 4:** is your current oil and oil soft cap, this cap is raised by 100 per HQ level. You can still gain more oil from buying oil with gems, commission, event/mission rewards or redeeming mails but will **NOT** be able to take oil from the canteen. The absolute oil **hard cap is 25,000 oil**. You cannot gain oil in any way if you hit this hard cap.
- **Element 5:** is your current gold and gold soft cap, this cap is raised by 600 per HQ level. Same deal as oil, still gain more gold from buying gold with gems, commission, event/mission rewards or redeeming mails but will **NOT** be able to take gold from the merchant. The absolute gold **hard cap is 600,000 gold**. You cannot gain gold in any way if you hit this hard cap.
- **Element 6:** is your current gems stock, the premium currency so to speak, you can gain more by buying in the gems shop, some packs, 3 starring story map missions and some lucky urgent commissions (a minimal amount if any). Therefore as a F2P player, gems is a luxury and should always go into permanent upgrades instead of consumables. Recommended gem expenditure would be the following first before: 
  * **Dormitory slots: The 3rd dorm slot cost 300 gems, 4th cost 500 gems, 5th cost 800 gems and 6th cost 1200 gems.** The 2nd floor, which can be unlocked after you have fully expanded using furniture coins, cost **500 gems** and only provide morale regeneration and no exp gains. The 6th slot cost a lot and could be optionally skipped.
  * **Dock space expansion:** cost 200 gems per 10 slots until the 2000 dock space, after which it will cost 300 gems per 10 slots up to the cap of 3000 dock space.
  * Academy 3rd slot unlock: cost 500 gems and not that needed since you *eventually* don't need to raise so many skills as the main bottleneck is skill books).
  * There are always consumables to spend gems on such as oil refills, skins, pledge rings, etc

### Right side bar (element 7-12)
- **Element 7:** This is the memento section, including the following ordered from top to bottom: ![](https://i.imgur.com/xZ1nmjz.png)
    * **Archives** showcases all collectible ships ships in the game, with a handy filter in the top right.
    * **Retrofit** contains all retrofitted version of ships, also has a filter on the top right.
    * Note: Collection ratio includes all archives and retrofits *EXCEPT* collab ships
    * [**Bands (also known as Collection)**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/List_of_Collections) is a particular collection goal that rewards gems, dorm furniture, unique equipment or unlock exclusive ships. It is recommended to finish the Beaver Squad collection ASAP (LB2 at minimum level 30, all 5 ships is enough stars) because it gives one of the best evasion boosting auxiliary equipment in the game.
    * [**Memories:**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Memories) Cutscenes collection, you can rewatch all previously seen cutscenes here. If you scroll to the bottom or click on the Ships filter in the top right, you can find all the ships that has secretary questlines unique to them, to start it, set them as secretary in any slot and click on them. Except Akashi who has a longer questline to unlock her, details can be found [here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Akashi/Questline)
    * **Gallery:** Artwork collection. Some Loading screens and Intro artwork can be found here. No requirement to unlock them, you just need to download them individually to view them.
    * **Jukebox:** Music collection. Listen to the BGM here if you haven't gotten tired of it already.
- **Element 8:** Ranking a.k.a tryhard zone: Fleet power, Collection ratio, Exercise, Total event currency, Challenge Mode and event EX map all have rankings here.
- **Element 9:** Friends interface, rarely useful, add friend to slide into their DMs or visit their dorm.
- **Element 10:** Mail box, maintenance compensation, Exercise (PvP) promotion rewards, monthly pass are sent here. Mails do **NOT** have an expiration date and you can save the resources here for a rainy day when you need it. 
- **Element 11:** Notice a.k.a the announcement/patch note page everyone immediately close upon logging in the game, you can review it here.
- **Element 12:** Settings has the following
    * **Account** has your Account binding and secondary password to prevent others from unlocking ships or scrapped enhanced equipment
    * **Options** has FPS lock, Notification settings, Misc settings. Tinker around as you see fit
    * **Control** allows you to change your in-combat interface
    * **Audio** has volume sliders and audio/L2D updates

### Middle of the screen (element 13-18 and 27-30)
- **Element 13:** Lists of banners, events generally have 3-5 banners all running concurrently, including but not limited to ongoing event, time-limited skins, packs, dorm sets, construction rate-up.
- **Element 14:** Formation page, change your fleets and Meowfficers here. Note: Hard mode from story or event maps has specific requirements and need to be setup on the interface itself.
- **Element 15:** Battle/Sortie. Please refer to section [Battle Interface](#battle-interface)
- **Element 16:** Event page. Although the poster girl change from time to time, this button is static and will always direct you to the Event page which has all the current events on the left side that you can scroll through and some on the bottom part instead so do pay attention to the bottom bar too.
- **Element 17:** Event Maps, a shortcut to the event map instead of going to the story map then click on the event map icon.
- **Element 18:** Event "festival ground?", some events have their own festival ground that has varying facilities. Do go here everyday since these festival ground have either beneficial buffs or event mini-games.
- **Element 27:** Chat box. To turn it off, click on the red button at the bottom left. Alternatively click anywhere else on it to expand it: filter messages at the top, change room by clicking on the red Room button, change where you send your messages by clicking on the Bottom bar World/Guild button, send stickers by clicking the emoji face.
- **Element 28:** Inspect your secretary, as well as zoom-in/out, move around to view their artwork
- **Element 29:** AR camera interface, take a picture IRL and you can set your waifus fittingly in
- **Element 30:** Secretary cycle button, after you set more than one secretary, you can cycle between them using this button.

### Bottom bar (element 19-26)

Each of this is a section of its own due to their content. Some are just so long I kinda give up giving a run down since the details are on the wiki and the game does a sufficient job of explaining it.

#### Shops

As many as there are, collectively are all here. They are mainly divided to 2 type: the ~~scam cat/whale~~ gem shop a.k.a [Akashi's shop](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Akashi%27s_Shop) and all the other currency - the Munition shop a.k.a [Shiranui's shop](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shops).
  * [Akashi's shop](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Akashi%27s_Shop) includes:
      1. Skin shop: sells skins obviously, some skins are L2D that cost a bit more but now you can admire your waifus as if they are 3D than as a 2D png.
      2. Gems shop: you can refill your gem stock using real world money. The monthly pass is also here which has the "best" value. All other gems pack has a first buy double bonus **which RESET every year on the anniversary**
      3. Packs shop: the wiki list all the packs already. Nothing more to say about it besides: *Ring pack OP*
      4. Items shop: the wiki, besides listing all the items, also includes an oil refill price list
      5. [**Akashi's Gift:**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Akashi%27s_Shop#Akashi.27s_Gifts) this is important, you should get all the rewards from Akashi even if you are F2P by just tapping on her twice a day.
  * [Shiranui's shop](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Shops) includes: 
      1. Prototype shop: quote from the wiki: "Allows you to turn shipgirl blueprints of PR ships which are Developer Level 30 into Prototype Core's to invest into other PR ship blueprints or weapon blueprints.". Basically end-game stuffs, PR gives 5 cores each, DR gives 20 cores each.
      2. Core Data shop: Core Data drops from **Hard mode STORY map** *NOT events*, some daily/weekly missions or events. Core Data gears are generally good, refer to the [Core Data Guide](Core%20Data%20Guide.md) for an extensive recommendation.
      3. Merit shop: (a.k.a Gold Bulin shop) Exercise or PvP currency shop, nothing worth much here: the occasional cubes, gold bulins, purple bulins if need be, T4 tech boxes are also nice to kickstart your early-mid game. The 3 ships: Albacore (SS), South Dakota (BB), Eldrige(DD) are all decent, you will eventually get them for your collection but for the early-mid game, you can safely ignore them.
      4. General shop: **some items cost GEMS so read the price tag carefully before you buy,** the main Gold shop. Nothing special to say besides a *personal* general recommendation: Purple Food > Blue Food > Cubes > Red skill books > other skill books = Purple T3 Aux Plates > everything else. Note: I do NOT encourage buying T4 Gold Tech boxes EVER because the value proposition is so low with not only the rate of a gold gear being low but can also land on a useless gold equipment instead. Feel free to disagree, it's your gold after all, the game has a lot of gold sinks (LB, awakening, research, retrofits, enhancing equipment, Meowfficers, construction and this shop), you decide what to dump your gold into, not me.
      5. Event shop: Kinda straight forward, buy what you need with the event currency that you get from daily mission and grinding event maps, here's a *personal* general event shop purchasing guide (do note that you should ask a help chat for your specific situation, this is just for a blanket view because exclusive event gears have always been good or at least niche on one unit): Gold/Oil (during event) > Exclusive Gears > Ships if you don't have > Aux and any needed Plates > (Optional Boxes if lacking specific gears) > DR BPs >= PR BPs > Chips/SSR Cat boxes > (Gear Skins /s) > the rest

#### [Dockyard](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Dockyard), the wiki details everything already but TL;DR from Bottom to top:
  
  ![](https://i.imgur.com/BGJKMMF.png)
  - Info: includes your ships stats, skills and overview of equipment:
    * EXP: When the ship reaches level 100/105/110/115, she can be awaken by tapping on the exp bar to further increase her level cap by 5. She can still gain **exp from sorties** into a bank (max 3 million) while being at the level cap. The cost for each awakening is detailed on the wiki.
    * Skills: can be leveled in the [Tactical Classroom in the Academy.](#HQ)
    * Gears: A gear sets button to the far right allows you to save your current gear loadout to quickly unequip/reequip all gears.
    * Bottom part of the UI allow you to: change her Skins, view the ship details in the Archives (to listen to her various unlocked voicelines for example), Lock/Unlock, View the comments on her, Inspect the artwork, set her as Favorite
     * Morale and Affinity is explained in the [Dorm section of the HQ](#HQ)
  - Gear: all ships have 5 equipment slots, what they can equip on each slot is listed here. 
    - For all vanguard ships, they will have a main gun of their class sometimes they can use a smaller caliber gun, an secondary weapon, be it a torpedo mount or a DD gun depending on their SHIP class (not hull class), an AA gun or in the case of absent of it, a unique gear slot (e.g DB for Shirakami Fubuki) and 2 Auxiliary slots.
    - For BB/BC/BBV/BM they have generally the same slots except their secondary can also be CL gun sometimes, replace the AA for a seaplane for BBV and they all use BB guns.
    - For CVs and CVLs, they have their own plane loadout and their limit break perks complement that, a combination of Fighters, DBs, TBs (and/or AA gun for most CVLs) and 2 Aux Slots
    - For ARs, they have 3 Aux Slots and 2 AA gun slots.
    - **Efficiency:** This is an often overlooked stat but it directly relates to how much damage an equipment in that slot will do. In layman's term, a slot equipment is a factor in determining what a ship ideal loadout for a specific situation. For exact damage calculations: refer to the [combat page](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Combat#Damage_Calculations) 
  - Limit Break: detailed in the [Limit Break Guide](Limit%20Break%20Guide.md)
  - Enhance: Quote from the wiki: 
    - This screen allows other ships to be permanently consumed in order to boost the stats of the currently selected ship, up to 12 at a time. 
    - The table at the top shows the current stats available for boosting (Firepower, Torpedo, Aircraft and Reload, depending on the type of weapons the ship is able to use). These bars will fill with EXP from merging ships that give boosts to those stats. This can be done to increase the stats up to their cap (which increases with every level and stops after level 100).
    - Basically, do it often for the ships you are using, it is basically free stats from white ships that you gain from farming maps.
  - Unique for PR/DR ships: Prototype ships do not have their Limit Break and Enhance page but instead uses their PR/DR BPs to enhance their stats and gain a boost of stats and efficiency at Dev 5/15/25, similar LB perks at Dev 10/20/30. They also have their unique system called Fate Simulation that uses their BPs to further enhance their luck stat and finally enhances their skill at level 5.
  -  [Retrofits:](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Dockyard#Retrofit) TL;DR: You spend gold and retrofit BPs obtained from **Hard Mode STORY maps** to retrofit the ships, giving them a slew of stats, slot efficiencies, sometimes the following: a new skill and/or enhance their existing one, changes their equipment slots to other LB perks. Retrofit BPs drop are always based on the map you run:
     - X-1: Destroyer
     - X-2: Cruiser
     - X-3: Battleship
     - X-4: Carrier

#### Depot
Equipment of all sort goes here split into 3 tabs on the bottom right:
  - **Items:** your storage for food, medals, cubes, quick finishers, tech boxes, plates, skill books retrofit and PR BPs and other commemorative and miscellaneous items. There's an assortment of things in here but there isn't a cap on how much you can store so don't fret on it. **Tip on using Tech boxes:**
    * T1 can be combined to T2 and T2 to T3 at a ratio of 6:1. You cannot craft T4 boxes however.
    * T1 tech boxes have the most gold from dismantling gears so at late game when you don't need purple gears from boxes anymore, just open them as is for emergency gold.
    * For early game, it is recommended that you combine them to open for potential purple gears. The drop table for each faction tech boxes can be found [here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Equipment#Equipment_Box_Contents)
  - [**Gears:**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Equipment#Ship_Equipments) has the following feature:
    * Gears and Gear Skins: switch on the left hand side.
    * Disassembly (a.k.a scrapping) mode: enter by pressing the disassemble button on the bottom right to mass scrap up to 40 pieces of equipment at a time. 
    * Click on this button ![](https://i.imgur.com/ZlkaoJz.png) to have a rough understanding of weapon diameters.
    * Toggling the equipped button to see all currently equipped gears as well. 
    * Sort gears on the top right by slots, type, rarity and enhance level
    * Base depot capacity is 300 slots, you can expand it by 20 slots for 100 gems through the [Akashi's Shop](#Shops)
    * Enhance cost can be found on the wiki link
  - [**Designs:**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Equipment#Design) This is where you craft equipment BPs you get from running maps, researches into full pieces of equipment that you can use.  
  
  ![](https://i.imgur.com/pgiqmFh.png)
   
#### HQ:
HQ split into 3 portions: Academy, Dormitory and Cat Lodge/Meowfficer.
#### [**Academy:**] 
unlocked upon clearing the tutorial, includes: 
  * [**Lecture Hall:**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Living_Area#Lecture_Hall) The wiki will provide all the information needed so I'll just go over some of the key points:
    1. Unlocked at HQ/commander level 50 and can be upgraded every 5 levels after.
    2. Only MLB level 100+ ships can generate proficiency ONLY from sorties.
    3. Lecture runs for 12 hours. 
    4. The consumed XP is calculated at the time the lecture is claimed. This means that even if you start the lecture with little XP in the bar but earn XP while the lecture is ongoing, that XP will be consumed and given to the ships in the lecture.
    5. Ships in the Dorm cannot participate in Lectures. Lectures do not prevent participation in any other activities (like sorties or commissions).
    6. Lectures drain morale slowly to 0. Ships with low morale cannot participate.
      
  * [**Tactical Class:**](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Living_Area#Tactical_Class) a.k.a Skill training. You start with 2 slots and can unlock the 3rd slot with 500 gems. Using proper skill books for the skill gives a +50% exp. **Tips on skill training and skill books:**
    - When starting out, level skills to level 6-7 across the board barring exceptions (e.g Portland's Red skill) b4 deciding to level one to level 10. Skills that is most commonly recommended to level to 10 1st after that are barrage skills, damage buffs (e.g Enty's only skill), fleet stat buff (e.g Leander's Yellow skill).
