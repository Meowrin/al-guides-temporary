# Beginner 101

So you just downloaded this waifu collector gacha game called Azur Lane, you went through the starting tutorial and now met with a UI that makes no sense and guides that uses shorthand that makes no sense. Well let me explain the UI in a straight forward manner but before we begin here's a guide to [**BIND YOUR FOOKING ACCOUNT**](https://i.imgur.com/roy6tih.jpg), because you do not need to reroll in Azur Lane like most other gacha games, here's a short list of reasons why:

- Cubes and Gold are given in abundance when you are starting out. You'll get the ships you want eventually.
- A large majority of high value ships are not SSR rarity.
- Several of the most cost-effective, progression-friendly ships are drops, not builds.
- The tutorial can take 15 minutes or longer.
- SSR rates are 7% anyway.

### Useful Shorthands
<details>
  <summary> Rarity </summary>
     * Common: N (Grey/White)
     * Rare: R (Blue)
     * Elite: SR (Purple)
     * Super Rare: SSR (Yellow)
     * Ultra Rare: UR (Rainbow)
     * Prototype Rare: PR (Yellow)
     * Decisive Rare: DR (Rainbow)
     * Why is this like this? Don't ask me, idk, JP/FGO stuffs. It makes more sense to say it like that, EN do have a tendency to call Super Rare as SR but then get stumped on what to call purple cause Elite just sounds strange, what kind of rarity is Elite?
</details>
<details>
  <summary> Factions </summary>
     * Sakura Empire: IJN (Japan)
     * Eagle Union: USS (America)
     * Royal Navy: HMS (Britain)
     * Ironblood: KMS (German)
     * Eastern Radiance: ROC/PRAN (China)
     * North Union: SN (Russia)
     * Iris Libre: FFNF (Free France)
     * Vichya Dominion: MNF (Occupied France)
     * Sardegna Empire: RN (Italy)
     * There's also 2 common names for gears: SKC for German equipment and MLE for France equipment. Because these are present in the name so it's a bit more intuitive like that.
</details>
<details>
  <summary> Hull Class </summary>
     * Destroyer: DD ![DD](/resources/45px-DD_img40.png)
     * Light Cruiser: CL ![CL](/resources/45px-CL_img40.png)
     * Heavy Cruiser: CA ![CA](/resources/45px-CA_img40.png)
     * Large Cruiser: CB ![CB](/resources/45px-CB_img40.png)
     * Battleship: BB ![BB](/resources/45px-BC_img40.png)
     * Battlecruisers: BC ![BC](/resources/45px-BC_img40.png)
     * Aviation Battleships: BBV ![BBV](/resources/45px-BBV_img40.png)
     * Monitors: BM ![BM](/resources/45px-BM_img40.png)
     * Aircraft Carriers: CV ![CV](/resources/45px-CVL_img40.png)
     * Light Aircraft Carriers: CVL ![CVL](/resources/45px-CVL_img40.png)
     * Submarines: SS ![SS](/resources/45px-SS_img40.png)
     * Submarine Carriers: SSV ![SSV](/resources/45px-SSV_img40.png)
     * Repair Ships: AR ![AR](/resources/45px-AR_img40.png)
     * The ship hull class can be intuited through their icons but some just have downright the same icon therefore the only way to know what ship is in what hull class is in their ship profile in the dock. Explained later in the Dock section.
     * Why is hull class important? 
     1. Vanguard ships including: DD, CL, CA and CB are your "frontline" ships, the ones that you actually control with your joystick. 
     2. Main fleet ships including: BB, BC, BBV, BM, CV, CVL and AR are your "backline" ships, who provide Artillery support fire and/or Airstrikes (BBVs provide both for example). 
     3. Submarine fleet including SS and SSV is another can of worm, unlocked after you clear chapter 3 map 4. A detailed guide about Submarines, Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW) and Rescue Missions can be found [here made by pootatoast](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/User:Itsfyh/Submarines) (also in the helpful resources section of the readme)

- [Right side bar (element 7-12)](#Right-side-bar-(element-7-12))
- [Bottom bar (element 19-26)](#Bottom-bar-(element-19-26))
- [Middle of the screen (element 13-18 and 27-30)](#Middle-of-the-screen-(element-13-18-and-27-30))

### Top bar (element 1-6)
- **Element 1:** **the LV. is your HQ or Commander level**, leveling up while grants little to no immediate benefits but is quintessential to your progression ([details here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Experience#Commander_XP)). Clicking on your secretary portrait takes you to your profile page. The profile page show you some basic data with some customization options. Top right "Style" is where you can customize your profile and chat border as well as medallion showcase. Bottom left is where you can change your greetings. Bottom left is where you can change your secretary as well as set your main secretary (who gains affection/hour). You unlocked more secretary slots for cosmetics after clearing the specified story maps.
- **Element 2:** is your quick access side bar. You can collect Canteen Oil and Merchant Coins passive generation here without going to the Academy page, check on Commission teams, Tactical Classroom (NOT the Lecture Hall) and your Research Academy. One of the places you will check the most in the game.
- **Element 3:** Your "Beginner Missions" that gives a lot of resources and an SSR ship at the end (all 4 ship is also permanent available, recommendation for the ship is Hood if you don't have a BB/BC or Enterprise if you need a CV, Sandy is nice with retro but not that needed)
- **Element 4:** is your current oil and oil soft cap, this cap is raised by 100 per HQ level. You can still gain more oil from buying oil with gems, commission, event/mission rewards or redeeming mails but will **NOT** be able to take oil from the canteen. The absolute oil **hard cap is 25,000 oil**. You cannot gain oil in anyways if you hit this hard cap.
- **Element 5:** is your current gold and gold soft cap, this cap is raised by 600 per HQ level. Same deal as oil, still gain more gold from buying gold with gems, commission, event/mission rewards or redeeming mails but will **NOT** be able to take gold from the merchant. The absolute gold **hard cap is 600,000 gold**. You cannot gain gold in anyways if you hit this hard cap.
- **Element 6:** is your current gems stock, the premium currency so to speak, you can gain more by buying in the gems shop, some packs, 3 starring story map missions and some lucky urgent commissions (a minimal amount if any). Recommended gem expenditure should always be permanent upgrade such as **Dormitory slots, Dock space expansion** or Academy 3rd slot unlock (not that needed since you eventually don't need to raise so many skills as the main bottleneck is skill books). The 3rd dorm slot cost 300 gems, 4th cost 500 gems, 5th cost 800 gems and 6th cost 1200 gems. The 2nd floor, which can be unlocked when you have fully expanded using furniture coins, cost 500 gems and only provide morale regeneration and no exp gains. Dock space cost 200 gems per 10 slots until the 2000 dock space, after which it will cost 300 gems per 10 slots up to the cap of 3000 dock space.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage, AngularJS powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

  - Type some Markdown on the left
  - See HTML in the right
  - Magic

# New Features!

  - Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
  - Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)


You can also:
  - Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
  - Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML to Markdown converter
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |


### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma test
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud
