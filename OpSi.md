# Operation Siren Guide

A massive new game mode has just been introduced, this is a basic beginner guide for people who skimmed through the tutorial along with some quick advices/basic answers from someone who no-lifed this for 6 hours. This is very new so everything is new and unknown, please be patient while this gets updated.

## FAQ and TL;DR/Most important advices:
- **READ THE TUTORIAL**. A lot of questions are answered in the tutorial, remember it, the game won't repeat it.
- (Optional) **Read the patch note**. This is a link to the ALEC (Azur Lane English Community/Azur Knights) JP patch note: https://discord.com/channels/321283108122918924/362997422018002944/790860232594817034
- **__PAY ATTENTION WHEN SETTING UP YOUR 1ST 2 FLEETS__**. Changing fleets and cats cost a lot of AP. 100 AP each. The cost get reduced down to 0 over time but it takes roughly 12-24? hours for it. The 1st one is free but AP is important, don't waste it on dumb stuffs. Just set your strongest fleet with your best cats 1st, make every fleet a combination of a boss fleet in terms of damage but if possible use a healer like Perseus or Ryuuhou (until high corrosion that limit healing capability).
- **"Everything is so confusing, what do?"** This is content that is permanent for the most part (the META ships are seasonal). Don't worry too much. But it will take a lot of time and consistent game time to grind. AP has a soft cap of 100, regen 1 point per 10 mins.
- "How do I get out of the map when I finished clearing?" click outside of the map to go to the overworld view. Some says they can't unless they have a fleet at the edge so if you can't exit, move a fleet to the edge. (The back button is a quick way to get to the overworld map view but won't exit your fleets from the current region)
- "What to buy with Supply Coin and Item Tokens?" Don't know yet, they will be exchanged for some kind of voucher ticket every season anyways so use them liberally.
- "Why do some region drop no EXP, what gives?" Story region gives no exp whatsoever, all maps do not give affection as well.

## General Gameplay and Maps:

#### General Gameplay:
- There's 3 important things 1st: 
   - Fleet swapping is bottom left now cause you will eventually get access to up to 4 fleet simultanously. 
   - Order tab: on the radar on the right side of the screen. Change fleet, resting to heal up and remove fatigue, recon, submarine call-ins all cost AP. Change fleet cost up to 100 AP, slowly drain to 0 over time. Rest cost a static 50. recon cost up to 12? drain to 0 over 15-30 mins.
   - Scanning mode: clunky piece of shit but important to locate hidden cache. If you do not have the entire map reveal through recon, you gonna need to go here often to locate hidden cache that will not show up on the map.
- Don't be afraid of retreating or restarting, you don't have morale or oil cost to worry about, restart as much as you want to get the outcome that you want

#### Overworld map:

- Ports: currently USS, HMS ports are known, they have their own shop that refresh every 3 days approx. There's 2 kind of currency: coins and tech coin. We currently don't know much but using the battle coins liberally is fine.
- Includes regions that cost AP to enter (story regions 1st clear cost 0 AP to enter and 0 AP to scan)
- Regions: Cost AP to enter

### Regional maps and effects/point of interest:

- Think of it as normal maps in every chapter in main campaign
- Every fleet has their movement restricted in turns (much like event maps where you have limited movement tiles). Same concept here but turns actually have an effect on the map. The map is semi-dynamic in that mobs might spawn in over time, cat salvages overtime discovering elite fleets (enhanced enemies with modules and more drops)
- Recon reveal the entire map so scanning mode will reveal hidden cache more effectively

#### Modules
Offense, Defense, Healing modules all either buff or debuff your fleet in battle. You can increase it with items or modules collected in the map

#### Main OpSiren Story
First time you enter an area for the story it costs no AP, it will cost AP after that. They also do not give EXP.

#### Map stars
- Each map has 5 stars you can get.
Press information -> exploration progress to show the  objectives for the current area. 3 objectives are revealed on the first time you enter an area. [Intel] can spawn [randomly(?)] revealing an additional star requirement.
- Star rewards are claimed at ports

#### Siren Jamming 
Occasionally on collecting an item you will be jammed, reducing your movement to 1 tile for the next 5 moves.

#### Meowficers Node
Upon entering the tile you will be asked whether or not you want to deploy Meowficers to gather resources. If you choose to, your meowficcer skills will be disabled for an amount of tile movements based on the map, then they will return with rewards. Rewards are based on Meowficcer levels and rarity.

#### Whirlpool
Entering or moving into a whirlpool will stop you there, and each time you try to move out you might be stunned eating your moevement, meaning that reinforcements can spawn and move closer. Movement out of the Whirlpool is restricted to 1 tile.

#### Siren Rally Points
Siren rally points will keep spawning reinforcement fleets until all of them are destroyed. You can destroy them by moving onto them, which might force you into a fight with a siren defense fleet. Defeating the fleet will remove the rally point

#### Fog
Movement in fog is restricted to 1 tile. Normally there will be a Fog generator that you can go to and remove all fog on the map.

#### Energy matrix:
Collect the Matrix on the map and deliver it to the platform to get rewards.

## Enemies

#### Sirens
Sirens move whenever you move three times, and unlike events they move 5 tiles at once instead of 2, so plan ahead if you want to avoid them with your fleets.

#### Dangerous enemies (Mixed Recon Fleets)
Have specialized modules that buff stats/defense making them incredibly hard to kill without the proper damage type.

## Ashes Coordinate and Hiryuu META: Excerpt from the patch note
You can obtain Analysis Points by defeating the META boss in Ashes Showdown.
Achieve Analysis Point milestones to obtain META ships and other rewards.

Ashes Showdown involves the following 2 elements,
1) Ashes Coordinate Analysis (unlocking the boss fight)
2) Fighting the META boss

※ Ashes Showdown is unlocked after clearing chapter 1 of the Operation Siren story campaign.

★ Ashes Coordinate Analysis
You can obtain Ashes Coordinates from a number of ways including defeating enemies.
The number of Ashes Coordinates is displayed on the upper right corner of the sea region map.

Once you have obtained the max number of Ashes Coordinates, you can unlock the META boss fight by performing Coordinate Analysis using all of your Coordinates.
You can only perform Coordinate Analysis twice per day.
After daily reset, you will be able to perform Coordinate Analysis again, but the number of your Ashes Coordinates will be reset back to the starting number.

★ Fighting the META boss
You can access the fight from the button on the lower right corner of the sea region map.
The META boss fight involves,
1) The fight that you yourself unlock
2) Any requests for backup that you accept from other commanders.

Fleets sortied for Operation Siren can be used for the boss fight. Meowfficers and submarines cannot be used.
Once you complete a META boss fight that you unlocked yourself, the next META boss will be harder (a level increase).
Requesting for backup allows other commanders to access your META boss fight.

Defeating the boss rewards Analysis Points. If it was a coop fight, all commanders who participated will receive Analysis Points.

※ A META boss fight will be open for 24 hours.
※ You may spend Fuel and attempt the META boss fight which you unlocked yourself as many times as you would like until the boss is defeated.
※ There is a limit on how many backup requests you can accept per day.
※ A maximum of 30 commanders can participate in 1 Ashes Showdown. The boss fight will become unable to join once full.
※ Ashes Showdown does not give any ship EXP nor does it affect ship morale and affection.
