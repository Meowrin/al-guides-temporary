# Operation Siren Guide

A massive new game mode has just been introduced, this is a basic beginner guide for people who skimmed through the tutorial along with some quick advices/basic answers from someone who no-lifed this for 3 hours. This is very new so everything is new and unknown, please be patient while this gets updated.

## FAQ and TL;DR/Most important advices:
- **READ THE TUTORIAL**. A lot of questions are answered in the tutorial, remember it, the game won't repeat it.
- (Optional) **Read the patch note**. This is a link to the ALEC (Azur Lane English Community/Azur Knights) JP patch note: https://discord.com/channels/321283108122918924/362997422018002944/790860232594817034
- **__PAY ATTENTION WHEN SETTING UP YOUR 1ST 2 FLEETS__**. Changing fleets and cats cost a lot of AP. 100 AP each. The cost get reduced down to 0 over time but it takes roughly 4-5 hours for it. The 1st one is free but AP is important, don't waste it on dumb stuffs.
- **"Everything is so confusing, what do?"** This is content that is permanent for the most part (the META ships are seasonal). Don't worry too much. But it will take a lot of time and consistent game time to grind. AP has a soft cap of 100, regen 1 point per 10 mins.
- "How do I get out of the map when I finished clearing?" click outside of the map to go to the overworld view. Some says they can't unless they have a fleet at the edge so if you can't exit, move a fleet to the edge. (The back button is a quick way to get to the overworld map view but won't exit your fleets from the current region)

## General Gameplay and Movement

#### General Gameplay:
- 

#### Overworld map:

- Ports: currently USS, HMS ports are known, they have their own shop that refresh every 3 days approx. There's 2 kind of currency: coins and tech coin. We currently don't know much but using the battle coins liberally is fine.
- Includes regions that cost AP to enter (story regions 1st clear cost 0 AP to enter and 0 AP to scan)
- Regions: basi

#### Regional maps:

- Think of it as normal maps in every chapter in main campaign
- 

#### Clearing Maps
X bosses spawn on each map, there is a fog of war that lifts once you destroy all enemies on the map.

#### Moving out of the map
Move to the edge of a map, and click outside of it to exit the map

## Main OS Story
First time you enter an area for the story it costs no AP, it will cost AP each time after that

## Map stars
Each map has 5 stars you can get.
Press information -> exploration progress to show the  objectives for the current area. 3 objectives are revealed on the first time you enter an area. [Intel] can spawn [randomly(?)] revealing an additional star requirement.

## Enemies

#### Sirens
Sirens move whenever you move three times, and unlike events they move 5 tiles at once instead of 2, so plan ahead if you want to avoid them.

#### Dangerous enemies
asdasd

## Status effects/debuffs

#### Siren Rally Points
Siren rally points will keep spawning reinforcement fleets until all of them are destroyed. You can destroy them by moving onto them, which will force you into a fight with a siren defence fleet. Defeating the fleet will remove the rally point

## Map/environment nodes


#### Siren Jamming 
Occasionally on collecting an item you will be jammed, reducing your movement to 1 tile for the next 5 moves.


#### Meowficcer Node
Upon entering the tile you will be asked whether or not you want to deploy Meowficcers to gather resources. If you choose to, your meowficcer skills will be disabled for an amount of tile movements based on the map, then they will return with rewards. Rewards are based on Meowficcer levels.

#### Whirlpool
Entering or moving into a whirlpool will stop you there, and each time you try to move out you might be stunned eating your moevement, meaning that reinforcements can spawn and move closer. Movement out of the Whirlpool is restricted to 1 tile.

#### Fog
Movement in fog is restricted to 1 tile.





## Hiryuu META
Need 100 coordinates to challenge for yourself
You can help others up to 3x a day, giving you rewards based on the level of that specific instance of Hiryuu.
