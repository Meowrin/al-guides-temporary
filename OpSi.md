# Operation Siren Guide


## Movement and playing

#### Clearing Maps
X bosses spawn on each map, there is a fog of war that lifts once you destroy all enemies on the map.

#### Moving out of the map
Move to the edge of a map, and click outside of it to exit the map

## Main OS Story
First time you enter an area for the story it costs no AP, it will cost AP each time after that

## Map stars
Each map has 5 stars you can get.
Press information -> exploration progress to show the  objectives for the current area. 3 objectives are revealed on the first time you enter an area. [Intel] can spawn [randomly(?)] revealing an additional star requirement.

## Enemies

#### Sirens
Sirens move whenever you move three times, and unlike events they move 5 tiles at once instead of 2, so plan ahead if you want to avoid them.

#### Dangerous enemies
asdasd

## Status effects/debuffs

#### Siren Rally Points
Siren rally points will keep spawning reinforcement fleets until all of them are destroyed. You can destroy them by moving onto them, which will force you into a fight with a siren defence fleet. Defeating the fleet will remove the rally point

## Map/environment nodes


#### Siren Jamming 
Occasionally on collecting an item you will be jammed, reducing your movement to 1 tile for the next 5 moves.


#### Meowficcer Node
Upon entering the tile you will be asked whether or not you want to deploy Meowficcers to gather resources. If you choose to, your meowficcer skills will be disabled for an amount of tile movements based on the map, then they will return with rewards. Rewards are based on Meowficcer levels.

#### Whirlpool
Entering or moving into a whirlpool will stop you there, and each time you try to move out you might be stunned eating your moevement, meaning that reinforcements can spawn and move closer. Movement out of the Whirlpool is restricted to 1 tile.

#### Fog
Movement in fog is restricted to 1 tile.
